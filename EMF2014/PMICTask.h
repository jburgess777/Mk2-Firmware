 PMICTask
 This task looks after Power Management keeping and eye on battery voltage, lipo battery charging
 It notifies other task of the battery voltage, charge state.

 make current charge sate available
 read voltage at regular intervals and make available
 notify on significant points
 notify on charge state change
 allow interval period change (for sleeping at night)
